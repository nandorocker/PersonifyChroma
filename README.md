Chroma Manifesto
===

## Our goal

Our goal is to delight users in a way that surprises, exceeds expectations and hopefully creates a reason to recommend that tablet to their friends.

Chroma **should**:

- Enable anyone to produce exciting content
- Be a great reason to have a tablet with a **3d camera**, or recommend it to a friend.
- Fun and funny, silly or emotional. It should touch people's emotions.
- Be fun for all family
- Feed users ideas & inspiration to spark creativity
- Exceed expectations (not shovelware or crapware)
- Be simple to operate

Chroma **should not**:

- Be too restrictive
- Try too hard to be funny, over-the-top or slap-sticky
- Be Instagram, Vine, 
- Try to be everything
- Be a professional tool

## Every effect must have:

- A theme, a *raison d'etre*. It should not be called "black & white" but "noir" and that art direction will guide our decisions
- Affect background AND foreground in a cohesive way
- Display the advantages of 3d hardware
- Lots of properties that are triggered by automatically and manually by the user
- Delightful hidden surprises. Those can be hinted at through copy.

## Input/Output

Every effect should be a combination of things that get toggled on/off and whose intensity can be altered, all by the different inputs.

There are three types of inputs:

- **Automatic** (based on motion)
	- Variations are applied based on types of motion
	- Amount of motion
	- Speed (not yet available)
	- Direction (not yet available)
- **Toggles**
	- Toggles are way simpler than sliders, and directors can create entirely new effects by enabling/disabling them.
- **Taps**
	-
